       <b><span>T</span>ammy Hoskins-Robinson</b> is a 32 year old government employee from Philadelphia,
       PA. Her desire to be a part of the tech world started at Indiana University of
       PA, where she majored<br>in engineering. Although trying to break into a
       field of study that wasn't popular amoungst women, she remained determined
       to complete the course. She finished and graduated, being the first in her
       family to do so.

      After graduation, Tammy returned to Philadelphia and worked as a network
      engineer for a telecommunications company in the King of Prussia area of the
      state. Her experience there taught her that she had to work hard to become an asset
      so that it would be difficult for employers to release her when they had to downsize.
      However, she was unable to avoid the decision her employer made to outsource
      her position overseas. This did not deter her in any way as she sought
      to find her way to her next job.

      After being hired to replace a retired employee at a State Senators' office,
      Tammy knew she had to make this a steppingstone towards what she is destined
      to do in life. Reading about New York Code & Design Academy after searching
      for coding schools in Philadelphia, seemed almost like fate. The decision to
      then enroll in a Web Development course was just the beginning of her transition
      to becoming a full stack developer. She is committed to making that into a reality
      so stay tuned.
